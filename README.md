6.005Pingball
=============

For my final project in 6.005 (Elements of Software Construction at MIT) I had to recreate a pinball game. 

This project uses ANTLR to load different boards, a physics package to create a realistic environment, a server to integrate multiple boards, and a graphical user interface. 

The game runs from src/pingBall/Pingball.java
