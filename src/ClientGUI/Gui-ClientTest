Tests for GUI and clients through GUI:

Visual basic test:
	no arguments:
		should play the default board
		should play automatically
		
	load board:
		should start the board with the configuration specified with the board file
		start playing immediately (balls fall automatically)
		
	pause board:
		freeze all balls from moving
		if connected to a server, still accept balls
		connection should not be interrupted:
			still have connected board name displayed
			after unpause, balls passing through connected walls should still work
		
	resume board
		continue moving balls
		confirm that velocities don't change from pausing to unpausing
		test balls added during pause correctly move after unpause
	
	reload board:
		restarts the board to the state specified by the loaded board file, or default board if none is specified
		 
	connect board to server:
		"Connect" button should change to "Disconnect"
		On server end, should print out "BoardName connected" as confirmation
	
	portals:
		use portalOne and portalTwo board
		start server, then portalTwo.pb from command line connecting to server, then portalOne.pb from command line connecting to server 
		ball should travel from portalOne to portalTwo through the portal
	
	connect:
		connect two boards horizontally:
			names of maps connected should appear along the walls
			balls should pass through connected walls
		connect two boards vertically:
			same as above
		disconnect:
			names should disappear from both boards if they were connected
			all balls on disconnected client should be removed
			
	key control:
		load keyboardFlippers.pb
		releasing "r" should flip the leftmost flipper
		pressing "l" should flip the rightmost flipper
	
with command line arguments:
	only file provided:
		opens the pb file and starts a single player game
	
	file and hostname provided:
		opens the pb file and connects to the server at hostname, with default port number of 10987
		
	file, hostname, and port number 
		opens the pb file and connects to the server at hostname, with port number provided
