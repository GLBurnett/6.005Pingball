BoardBuilder GUI Visual Testing

all files should be written to top level of project, with a .pb extension  

GUI should be a grid of 20x20 buttons, that when clicked cycle through possible gadgets.
Also, a generate board button and board name text field are also present

Generate Board File:
	pressing generate button without any interaction:
		should write file deafultName.pb with one line: "board name=deafultName"
	
	generating board without supplying a board name:
		first line should always be "board name=deafultName" and have filename deafultName.pb
		
	generating board supplying a board name:
		first line should always be "board name=BOARD_NAME" and have filename BOARD_NAME.pb, where BOARD_NAME
			is the supplied board name
	
	generating a board with only one ball:
		second line should be "ball name=ballAtX_Y x=X y=Y xVelocity=0.0 yVelocity=0.0" where X 
			and Y are the chosen coordinates of the ball 
	
	triangleBumper:
		should have line "triangleBumper name=triangleBumperAtX_Y x=X y=Y orientation=ANGLE" where X 
			and Y are the chosen coordinates of the gadget and ANGLE is the chosen angle:
				-test all four angles to make sure they cycle through 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees
				
	squareBumper:
		should have line "squareBumper name=squareBumperAtX_Y x=X y=Y" where X 
			and Y are the chosen coordinates of the gadget
	
	circleBumper:
		should have line "circleBumper name=circleBumperAtX_Y x=X y=Y" where X 
			and Y are the chosen coordinates of the gadget	 
			
	portal:
		should have line "portal name=portalAtX_Y x=X y=Y  otherBoard=NAME otherPortal=NAME" where X 
			and Y are the chosen coordinates of the gadget
